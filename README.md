Part 1: Door Lock

Briefing:

We’ll add a keypad-based keyless door lock system to our home automation system. We’ll be using 4x4
keypad to enter a unique password known by the owner of the house and a DC lock to open and close
the door. As display well be using a 16x2 LCD.

Application area:

1. Added security to the house
2. No more fear of losing keys

Part 2: Automatic Room Lights

Introduction:

This project is based Arduino & ultrasonic sensor. Amazing thing of this project is it will automatically
On/Off the room lights depending on presence of human in the room.

Application:

We can implement this project in our garages, staircase, bathrooms, etc. where we generally forget to
turn off the lights. Also, it will save electricity, lights automatically turn on only if there is anyone in the
room.
This circuit can be used to count the number of persons entering a hall/mall/home/office in the
entrance gate and it can count the number of persons leaving the hall by decrementing the count at
same gate or exit gate and it depends upon sensor placement in mall/hall. It can also be used at gates of
parking areas and other public places.


Part 3: IR Remote Controlled Home Automation

Introduction:
Most remote controls around us, use IR for signal transmission. An IR remote control for home
appliances helps us connect to our devices at ease and operate them from the comfort of your bed or
your chair. Here we try to build an IR remote control for home appliances that can be used in our home.

Application:
This system resolves the problem by combining house hold appliances to control unit which will be
operated by a MP3 IR remote. For example: lighting in the house may now be adjusted automatically to
meet the demands of the individual. Moreover we can control almost all electronic devices in our home
like using IR remote. Like TV, fan,AC etc


Software:
1. Arduino IDE
2. TInkercad
   
Packages:
1. IRRemote by Arminjo
2. LiquidCrystal
3. EEPROM

Languages:
1. C/C++
